## PERSONAL STYLIST APP

The Personal Stylist website was created to help women that want a personalized capsule wardrobe and don't know where to start!

The objective of this project was to practice Haskell by building an API as well as practicing React, Hooks, and Typescript in the Frontend. Another personal goal achieved with his project is working with UI styling and functional CSS, in this case, Tachyons.

## Functionalities

- Generate a Capsule Wardrobe based on user input, with the number of pieces needed and suggested colors for each one.
- If the user wants, it's possible to bookmark the capsule wardrobe or share it copying and pasting the URL.
