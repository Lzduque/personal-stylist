## Getting Started

If you want to clone both repos locally and test them, this is the front-end repo, and the back-end repo is [here](https://github.com/Lzduque/personal-stylist-api).

1. Install Frontend dependencies using the `yarn install` command.
2. Install Backend dependencies using the `stack install` command.
3. Start Frontend using the `yarn start` command and `stack build && stack exec personal-stylist-exe\` for the Backend. The app will be served at <http://localhost:3000/> and the client at <http://localhost:3001/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:2000/> in your browser.

If you want to use the deployed version of the app, go to <https://lzduque.github.io/personal-stylist/>. The instructions to use the Backend API are in [here](https://github.com/Lzduque/personal-stylist-api).

This Website can also be used as an app, since it is an progressive web app:

1. Go to your browser and access the website [home page](https://lzduque.github.io/personal-stylist/) in your cellphone.
2. Click on the "share" or "options" button, whatever appears in your menu.
